Date: 2020-04-29

## Status

Approved

## Context

Decision for re-using the current Mobile app with update of self assigning the tickets.

## Alternatives

#### Use the current Mobile App for the Experts

##### Positive 

With easy update to the Mobile application, we can continue using the Mobile app. Experts are familier with Mobile App.

New update will give them confidence and self management.

It will help in Ticket Notification

##### Negative points

Unclear how easy to decouple the current Mobile App from the monolith and point to the new architecture. If APIs are not well thought an segregated then it might be not worth the effort.

#### Use the Omni channel browser based UI for Experts
