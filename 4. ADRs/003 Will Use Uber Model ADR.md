Date:

28th April, 2021

## Status

Approved

## Context

The core issue described in the Sysops squad is as follows

- never showing up due to lost tickets

- often times the wrong consultant shows up to fix something they know nothing about


## Decision

We will be using Uber model for self-assignment of System Ticket. 

## Consequences

Experts will take the responsiblity of the ticket - will reduce the chances of loosing it down to none

Correct expertise will take the job instead wrong assignment of job due to data error

Workers (Experts) can work on their own pace


# Positive

Additional Benefit to employees (Experts)

Reduce the complexity of managing Ticket Routing and Assignment

No lost of Tickets anymore

Right Consultant would choose the job according to their skill-set and location

# Negative 

There might be some cases where non of the Experts wants to take the ticket - may be at corner of the city or suberbs.

# Risks 

If case of tickets are not self-assigned by the Experts 
 - then Manager would have additional role to play where he will assign the ticket to suitable Expert

# Bonus Features 

Experts will be compensated additionally if they clear more tickets in a day than expected

NOTE: The business model for base tickets in a day and additional compensation is not given deep thoughts yet.
