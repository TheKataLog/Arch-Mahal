## Status

Approved

## Context

The core issue described in the Sysops squad is as follows
- never showing up due to lost tickets
- often times the wrong consultant shows up to fix something
they know nothing about


## Decision

We will be using Uber model for self-assignment of System Ticket. 

## Consequences




**Positive:** 
Additional Benefit to employees (Experts)
Reduce the complexity of managing Ticket Routing and Assignment
No lost of Tickets anymore
Right Consultant would choose the job according to their skill-set and location

**Negative:** If any
There might be some cases where non of the Experts wants to take the ticket - may be at corner of the city or suberbs.

**Risks:** 
If case of tickets are not self-assigned by the Experts 
 - then Manager would have additional role to play where he will assign the ticket to suitable Expert

**Bonus Features:** 
Experts will be compensated additionally if they clear more tickets in a day than expected

NOTE: The business model for base tickets in a day and additional compensation is not given deep thoughts yet.
