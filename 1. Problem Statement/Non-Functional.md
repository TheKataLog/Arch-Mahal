# Non functional Requirements

From the Business Drivers we have the following non-functional requirements:

| # | Non-functional Requirements |
|----|----|
| 1. | Downtime during migration should complete in after hours. The SysOps Squad application should be up before the next day business hours.
| 2. | BD.004 - The system must be highly available to Customers (internal/external)
| 3. | BD.005 - Resolve the frequent system crash
| 4. | BD.006 - The system must be responsive during the peak business hours
| 5. | The new system should be cheap and fast to develop and deploy: the business is having trouble right now so *cost* and *time-to-market* is essential
