# Constraints

Below listed global constraints for the solution that drives all trade-off decisions:

@TOUPDATE

1. Development team is limited, so the solution should be simple at the beginning to prove business ideas
2. Time-to-market is critical, and with support of the previous constraint, it should be super simple to deploy
3. AWS is the primary target platform for deployment
4. Budget is very limited, so OSS and tools provided by the target platform should end up higher in prioritization}
