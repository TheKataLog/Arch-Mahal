# Constraints \
\
Below listed global constraints for the solution that drives all trade-off decisions: \
\
@TOUPDATE\
\
1. Development team is limited, so the solution should be simple at the beginning to prove business ideas \
2. Time-to-market is critical, and with support of the previous constraint, it should be super simple to deploy\
3. AWS is the primary target platform for deployment \
4. Budget is very limited, so OSS and tools provided by the target platform should end up higher in prioritization}
